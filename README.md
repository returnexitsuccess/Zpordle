# Zpordle

Implementation and testing the optimal strategy to play [Zpordle](https://mabotkin.github.io/zpordle/)

Zpordle is a game where you try to guess a number between 1 and 1000 with the only information you get being the [p-adic distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P-adic_number#Topological_properties) between your previous guesses and the correct number.

This program plays many iterations of this game with optimal strategy and identifies the distribution of the number of guesses to win.
